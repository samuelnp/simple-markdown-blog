#simple-markdown-blog

This project is a minimal blog with posts and tags developed in Ruby on Rails. If you need a really simple blog with tags, MarkDown to generate content and one user, Simple Markdown Blog is for you.

It's still in active development. I want to add more features to get a fully functional minimal blog like comments, rss, sitemap and social share links.

## Use it

For use it you only need to clone this repo and install.

```
bundle
rake db:setup
rails s
```
**NOTE** Very soon I'll add support to deploy with Capistrano in Production environments without pain.

## Customize it

To customize you can edit config/application.yml for site configurations and app/assets/stylesheets/variables.css.scss to change primary color in website.
